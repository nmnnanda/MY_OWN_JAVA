/**
• class keyword is used to declare a class in java.
• public keyword is an access modifier. It means it is visible to all.
• static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. The core advantage of 
  the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method.
• void means it doesn't return any value
• main represents the starting point of the program.
• String[] args is used for command line argument.
• System.out.println() is used to print statement.
• Here, System is a class, out is the object of PrintStream class, println() is the method of PrintStream class.
