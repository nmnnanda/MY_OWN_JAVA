Memory Management
• Heap is the memory that gets created within the RAM for random access, where classes, objects and members 
created.
• Garbage collection is the backbone of JVM for dealing with memory and allocating and reclaiming the memory 
from heap.
• Heap and sack are the random memory types and heap is major memory, which is being use by Java 
programming.
• Heap memory is further classified into the three logical parts called generations - new, old, and permanent are 
the three generations of the heap memory.
• All three generations of memory are managed and handled by minor, major, and full garbage collection that 
helps to reclaim the unused memory from system by deleting the unreferenced objects from heap.
