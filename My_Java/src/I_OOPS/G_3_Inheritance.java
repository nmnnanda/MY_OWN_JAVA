/**  We can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
• In inheritance “extends” keyword is used to inherit a class.

• Class : It is a blueprint from which objects are created.

• Sub Class/Child Class: It is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, 
extended class, or child class.

• Super Class/Parent Class: The class whose properties and functionalities are used (inherited) by 
another class is called as base class or a parent class.

• Reusability: We can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.

• Extends keyword : It indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class.

• Super keyword : It is used to access methods of the parent class.

• This keyword : It is used to access methods of the current class.
