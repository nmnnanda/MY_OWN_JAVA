/**

• Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors.
• An Exception is an unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of the program.
• Errors are generated while writing a programming code.
• So these errors are displayed at compile time.
• Some of these errors do not show up at compile time but interrupts the normal flow of execution at run time.
• These errors are known as Exceptions in programming.
• An exception can occur for many different reasons. Following are some scenarios where an exception occurs.
• This is something that every programmer faces at any point of coding. They can occur from different kind of 
  scenarios like entering the wrong data by user, hardware failure, network failure, class not found, out of 
  memory, etc.


         Exceptionsin JAVA                                          Errors in JAVA
1. Occurs at compile time or run time                         1. Occurs at runtime
2. Possible to recover when exception occurs                  2. Impossible to recpover when error occurs
3. Type of exception may be either checked and unchecked      3. Error are of type unchecked
4. An exception is caused because of the code.                4. An error is caused due to lack of system resources.
5. Example : Out of memeory, etc.                             5. Example : Class not found
